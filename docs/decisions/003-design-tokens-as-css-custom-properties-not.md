# ADR-003: Design tokens as CSS custom properties, not Tailwind config

**Date:** 2026-04-24
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** The design handoff specifies exact hex values for the brand palette, warm neutrals, and semantic colors. We need these accessible in both Tailwind classes and raw CSS.

**Decision:** Define all design tokens as CSS custom properties in `globals.css` and reference them through Tailwind's `@theme inline` directive. This gives us `bg-brand-500`, `text-ink-3`, etc. as utility classes while keeping the source of truth in CSS vars.

**Trade-offs:**

- (+) Single source of truth for colors
- (+) CSS vars work in inline styles, component libs, and Tailwind
- (+) Easy to theme or override per-section (e.g., email reader paper tone)
- (-) Slightly more verbose than pure Tailwind config
