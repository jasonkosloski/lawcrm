# Architectural Decision Records

Each decision is numbered and immutable once written. If we reverse a decision, we add a new ADR that supersedes it.

## ADR-001: SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production

**Date:** 2026-04-24
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** We need a database that's zero-config for local development but production-grade when deployed.

**Decision:** Use SQLite via Prisma for local dev. Swap the `datasource` to PostgreSQL when deploying. Prisma abstracts the differences for most queries.

**Trade-offs:**
- (+) No Docker/postgres setup needed to start developing
- (+) DB file is portable, easy to reset (`rm dev.db && prisma migrate dev`)
- (-) Some Prisma features differ between SQLite and Postgres (e.g., `@db.Text`, full-text search, JSON querying)
- (-) Need to test against Postgres before production deployment

**Mitigation:** We'll switch to Postgres before building features that need full-text search or complex JSON queries. SQLite is fine for the CRUD-heavy early phases.

## ADR-002: App Router route groups for layout isolation

**Date:** 2026-04-24
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** All authenticated pages share the same app shell (sidebar + topbar), but we'll eventually have unauthenticated pages (login, public intake forms) that don't.

**Decision:** Use Next.js route groups: `(dashboard)` for authenticated pages inside the app shell, and future `(auth)` or `(public)` groups for pages without the shell.

**Trade-offs:**
- (+) Clean layout separation without URL nesting
- (+) Easy to add auth checks at the layout level later
- (-) Slightly deeper file nesting

## ADR-003: Design tokens as CSS custom properties, not Tailwind config

**Date:** 2026-04-24
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** The design handoff specifies exact hex values for the brand palette, warm neutrals, and semantic colors. We need these accessible in both Tailwind classes and raw CSS.

**Decision:** Define all design tokens as CSS custom properties in `globals.css` and reference them through Tailwind's `@theme inline` directive. This gives us `bg-brand-500`, `text-ink-3`, etc. as utility classes while keeping the source of truth in CSS vars.

**Trade-offs:**
- (+) Single source of truth for colors
- (+) CSS vars work in inline styles, component libs, and Tailwind
- (+) Easy to theme or override per-section (e.g., email reader paper tone)
- (-) Slightly more verbose than pure Tailwind config

## ADR-004: Fraunces for display only, Inter for all UI chrome

**Date:** 2026-04-24
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** The design uses three fonts. Fraunces is a personality font that should be used sparingly.

**Decision:** Fraunces is used exclusively for:
- Page titles (h1 in topbar)
- Email subjects
- Email body paragraphs
- KPI large numbers

Everything else — nav, buttons, labels, table cells, chips, inputs — uses Inter. JetBrains Mono for timestamps, metadata, and monospace elements.

**Rationale:** Over-using Fraunces would dilute the brand feel and make the UI feel like a blog rather than a professional tool.

## ADR-005: Schema is iterative, not upfront

**Date:** 2026-04-24
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** The initial schema covers 25 models from the design handoff, but the design data model is WIP. Real requirements will emerge during implementation.

**Decision:** Treat the Prisma schema as a living document. Build each feature end-to-end and adjust the schema as needed. Don't over-engineer models for features we haven't started building.

**Rationale:** Prisma migrations are incremental and cheap. It's better to evolve the schema with real requirements than to guess upfront and end up with unused fields or wrong relationships.
